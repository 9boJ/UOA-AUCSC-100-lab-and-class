#part 1 
#program that iterates over the following list of fruits and prints each one:
#fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

#fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
#prints the fruits list
#for i in fruits:
#    print(i)

#part 2
# a program that uses a for loop with the range() function to print numbers from 1 to 10.

#This will print numbers from 0 to 10
#for i in range(11):
#    print(i) 

####################################################
#part 3
#a program that uses a for loop and the range() function to print every third number between 1 and 30.

#This will print numbers from 1 to 30 with step 3
#for i in range(1, 30,3):
#    print(i)

#part 4 
# a program that calculates and prints the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.
# a plans holder 
#g = 0

#add the 1 to 100 and updats g evertime the loop is run by add i to g
#for i in range(1,101):
#    g+=i

# prints the sum of 1 to 100
#print(g)

#part 5 
#a program that asks the user to input a string and counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in the string.

#Asks the user for a string
#string = [input("Enter a string: ")]

# A vowel bank 
#vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"]

# nubmer of vowels in the string
#vowel_counts = 0

#for ever vowel in the string adds one to vowel count(vowel_counts)
#for i in string[0]:
#    if i == vowels[0]:
#        vowel_counts+=1
#    elif i == vowels[1]:
#        vowel_counts+=1
#    elif i == vowels[2]:
#        vowel_counts+=1
#    elif i == vowels[3]:
#        vowel_counts+=1
#    elif i == vowels[4]:
#        vowel_counts+=1

#print("Your string has " + str(vowel_counts) + " vowels!")
