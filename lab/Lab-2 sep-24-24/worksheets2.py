#part 1 

# a program that asks the user for a number and prints "Even number" if the number is even

# asks the user for a number 
#x = int(input("Enter a number: "))

#find the remainder of the numer if it was divided by 2 
#find_remainder = x%2 

#prints "Even number" if "find_remainder" is 0 
#if find_remainder == 0:
   #print("Even number")
